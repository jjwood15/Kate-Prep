Because dried peat moss, which is derived from sphagnum moss, contains no chemical additives and is a renewable resource, many gardeners use large amounts of it as a soil conditioner in the belief that the practice is environmentally sound. They are mistaken. The millions of acres of sphagnum moss in the world contribute more oxygen to the atmosphere than do all of the world's rain forests combined, and the garden soil industry is depleting these areas much faster than they can renew themselves.
Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the argument's reasoning?
Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the argument's reasoning?
 Choose 1 answer:Choose 1 answer:(Choice A, Checked, Incorrect)   Using a product may be environmentally unsound even if the product is a renewable resource and contains no chemical additive.Incorrect (selected)Using a product may be environmentally unsound even if the product is a renewable resource and contains no chemical additive.This might be a very tempting choice, but our task is to justify the arguer’s reasoning that using dried peat moss is not environmentally sound. While the arguer would agree with the truth of this statement, it’s not a principle that helps strengthen his argument. (Choice B, Correct)   A practice is not environmentally sound if it significantly reduces the amount of oxygen entering the atmosphere.CorrectA practice is not environmentally sound if it significantly reduces the amount of oxygen entering the atmosphere.The argument’s support tells us that dried peat moss uses up sphagnum moss, thus reducing the oxygen that the sphagnum moss would have contributed to the atmosphere. If this principle is valid, then it justifies the argument that using peat moss is not environmentally sound. (Choice C, Incorrect)   A practice is environmentally sound if it helps to protect rain forests that contribute large amounts of oxygen to the atmosphere.IncorrectA practice is environmentally sound if it helps to protect rain forests that contribute large amounts of oxygen to the atmosphere.The argument mentions rain forests only as a point of comparison with sphagnum moss, to emphasize how much oxygen sphagnum moss is responsible for contributing. Additionally, this choice establishes what makes a practice environmentally sound, not environmentally unsound. (Choice D, Incorrect)   If the environmental benefits of a practice outweigh the environmental costs, that practice can be legitimately considered environmentally sound.IncorrectIf the environmental benefits of a practice outweigh the environmental costs, that practice can be legitimately considered environmentally sound.The argument leads to a conclusion that a certain practice is environmentally unsound. This choice, which indicates what makes a practice environmentally sound, cannot justify the argument.(Choice E, Incorrect)   If the practices of an industry threaten a vital resource, those practices should be banned.IncorrectIf the practices of an industry threaten a vital resource, those practices should be banned.The conditions under which a practice should be banned doesn’t impact the argument, which focuses on 
what conditions make a practice environmentally unsound.
